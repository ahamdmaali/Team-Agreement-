# Conflict Plan
## Resolve conflict :
### When a coflict arises, we have to resolve it ASAP and remember that we have to have a good relationship to success the project
### Every member have to do the requerments that have to do, and we all in the team have to help each other when any member have missed something and we have to help them to find the soluatin.
### when the conflict rise again, I will escalate it to our manager.

# Communication Plan
## At the Off-hours tha slack channel will be the best way to connect each others.

# Work Plan
## The best way to identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work is by live connection using Zoom, but I dont mind if We use the slack channel too.

# Git Process
## Firstly, every thing edited have to pull to the repo immediately if it is raedy to deploy.
## The repo link will be in the slack channel and i hope to save it.
## The git flow had to be using A-C-P, and never edit files online, every edits have to be localy.
## Every one have to review all new edit on the repo, and commenting on it.
## After reviewing edits you have not to merge those edits to main branch
## Merging branches should be at every completed proccess, so dont merge any thing you want.
